# Famous Framework (BETA)

The Famous Framework is a JavaScript framework for creating expressive, high-performance UIs.

* **Reusable:** The Famous Framework is built around powerful constraints and a declarative syntax that make it easy to reuse components and seamlessly interchange them.

* **Connected:** Components built with the Famous Framework will be able to integrate with Famous realtime analytics, visual editing tools, and more, without writing any additional code. _(Coming soon!)_

* **Built on the Famous Engine:** The Famous Framework is built on the [Famous Engine](https://github.com/Famous/engine) to harness its high-performance rendering capabilities in DOM and WebGL.
